Configuration for more GPS Accuracy:

1. Use High-Accuracy GPS Mode (Mobile Settings)
On Android and iOS devices, GPS accuracy can often be improved by switching to a high-accuracy mode in location settings. Here's how:

On Android:
Go to Settings > Location > Mode or Location Accuracy.
Select High accuracy. This mode uses GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks to determine your location.
On iOS:
Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services.
Ensure that Location Services is enabled and set apps that require high accuracy (e.g., Maps or tracking apps) to While Using the App.
This method allows the device to combine multiple sources of data, improving location precision.

2. Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Even when not connected to a Wi-Fi network, enabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the device can assist in determining location more accurately. This is particularly useful in urban environments where GPS signals may be weak or obstructed.

Wi-Fi can help triangulate your position by detecting nearby networks.
Bluetooth beacons can also provide location data for fine-tuning your position.
